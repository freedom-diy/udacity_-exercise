//Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared stringToReverse and arrayOfCharacters as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with let, no variables. Note: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.

//var stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
//var arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.characters.reversed()
//stringToReverse = String(arrayOfCharacters)

let haveATry: String = "dream"
let arrayOfString = haveATry.reversed()
let stringToReverse = String(arrayOfString)  //swft 4
print(stringToReverse)
